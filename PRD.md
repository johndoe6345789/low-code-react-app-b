## Essential Features
### Log Parser & Error Highlighter

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
This is a diagnostic tool with log parsing, error highlighting, and solution generation - more than a single-purpose tool but not a complex multi-view application.

## Essential Features

### Log Parser & Error Highlighter
- **Functionality**: Paste Docker build logs and automatically extract error information
- **Purpose**: Make sense of lengthy, unformatted build output
- **Trigger**: User pastes log text into a text area

- **Functionality**: Common Docker build errors with explanations and fixes

- **Success criteria**: Cove
### Fix Code Generator
- **Purpose**: Speed up fixing by providing exact code changes needed
- **Progression**: Solution shown → Click "Generate Fix

  - Button (primary for actions, secondary for copy operations)

  

  - Monospace code blocks with line numbers for generated fixes

  - Input: Focused state has bright accent border with subtle glow
  
  - Terminal (for log input)
  - CheckCircle (for solutions)
  - MagnifyingGlass (for search in knowledge base)
  - Stack (for Docker layers)
- **Spacing**: 
  - Section gaps: gap-8 for major sections, gap-4 for related content

- **Mobile**: 

  - Collapsible sections for solutions to save space
